wurstmannberg.de website

Trying to make collaborative website updates a little less funky.
Wurstmannberg.de website version is meant to be updated via pulls from here, with as little changes to the deployed website directly.  

Beware: On wurstmannberg.de, the proper remote is named "github" (don't ask, it's clusterfucky), so after you push changes to github, you have to

    cd ~/wmb.de/httpdocs && git pull github master


Please don't make this mess any worse.
